# GE3171: Problem Solving and Python Programming

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python programs and exercises designed for the GE3171 course, focusing on problem-solving techniques and Python programming basics. The repository aims to help students understand fundamental programming concepts and apply them to solve real-world problems.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:

### 1. **Basics**
   - Programs covering Python syntax, variables, data types, and basic input/output.

### 2. **Control Structures**
   - Examples of conditional statements, loops, and iteration techniques.

### 3. **Functions**
   - Programs demonstrating user-defined functions, recursion, and built-in functions.

### 4. **Data Structures**
   - Implementation of lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and file handling.

### 5. **Libraries and Modules**
   - Exercises using libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy`.

### 6. **Mini Projects**
   - Hands-on projects that apply the concepts learned in the course.
